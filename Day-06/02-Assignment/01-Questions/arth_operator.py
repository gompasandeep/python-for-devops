# Step 1: Create variables a and b with numeric values
a = 20
b = 4

# Step 2: Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b
sum_result = a + b
difference_result = a - b
product_result = a * b
quotient_result = a / b  # This will give a floating-point division result

# Step 3: Print the results
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Quotient:", quotient_result)
